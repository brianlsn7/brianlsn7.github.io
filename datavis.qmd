<!-- SIT Logo -->
![](img/lab_sit_logo.png){width=100px}

## What was the project about?

I worked on a **phishing email detection project** to classify emails as phishing or non-phishing based on content and metadata.

The goal of this page is to explain **how I analyzed features** and visualized them.

## How did I use visualization?

I created a **bar chart** showing the top 5 numerical features for predicting phishing emails:

### Features included:
- **Subject Caps Percentage** – proportion of capital letters in the subject  
- **Body Caps Percentage** – proportion of capital letters in the email body  
- **Suspicious Keyword Count** – number of phishing-related words  
- **URL Label** – whether the URL is suspicious  
- **Composite Score** – weighted combination of multiple features  

## Why this visualization?

- A bar chart makes it easy to **compare numerical values across features**  
- Ordering from most to least important highlights key factors  
- Helps communicate insights to both **technical and non-technical audiences**

## What I learned

- Visualization clarifies which features are **most predictive**  
- Focusing on key metrics makes insights **actionable**  
- Clear visualizations improve **communication of findings**
