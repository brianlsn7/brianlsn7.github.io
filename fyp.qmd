# 🎓 Final Year Project: Phishing Email Detection

## What was the project about?

One of my past project focused on **machine learning-based phishing email detection**, aiming to automatically classify emails as phishing or non-phishing.

## How did I approach it?

Steps I took:
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**  
   - Collected emails and extracted numerical/categorical features  
2. **Feature Analysis and Selection**  
   - Identified top features using visualizations like the bar chart  
3. **Model Development**  
   - Trained classifiers like Random Forest and XGBoost  
4. **Evaluation and Deployment**  
   - Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
   - Integrated top model into a prototype email filter

## Achievements

- Achieved **high classification accuracy** without overfitting  
- Produced **explainable results** using feature importance visualizations  
- Maintained a **reproducible workflow** for data analysis and model training

## What I learned

- Combining **exploratory analysis, visualization, and machine learning** is powerful  
- Clear presentation of results improves **stakeholder understanding**  
- Reflection on each step helps me **improve future projects**
