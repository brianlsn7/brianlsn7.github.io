# 🤖 Reflection on the use of GenAI

## What GenAI tool did I use?

I used **ChatGPT** as my main GenAI tool.

I chose ChatGPT because it is easy to use and can help with:
- Writing content  
- Formatting in Markdown  
- Understanding Quarto syntax  
- Debugging errors  

## How did GenAI help me?

ChatGPT helped me:
- Generate page content when I was unsure how to start  
- Format my text using Markdown  
- Structure my website pages logically  

For example, it helped me write the **project page** and the **data visualization explanation** in a clear way.

## Benefits

- Saves time  
- Helps organize ideas  
- Reduces frustration when stuck  

## Challenges

Sometimes the generated text is too general, so I still had to:
- Edit the content  
- Add my own experience  
- Make it more personal  

## Future use

I think GenAI will be very useful for:
- Writing reports  
- Debugging code  
- Learning new topics  
- Preparing presentations  

It is a powerful assistant, but it still needs human judgment.
